Head researcher Dr. Ingrid Solberg here. I am pleased to say, today we embark on our first expedition into the ruins me and my associates unearthed. It marks the beginning of our extraordinary journey into the uncharted realms of the Serpent Folk. The first ruins we stumbled upon were shrouded in an ethereal aura of mystery and ancient wisdom. The stone structures, weathered by the passage of eons, stood as resolute sentinels, guarding the secrets of a civilization long lost in the annals of time. As we meticulously document these remarkable findings, we uncover intricate engravings and hieroglyphs, painstakingly deciphering the complex script that served as the Serpent Folk's mode of communication. We are humbled by the magnitude of their accomplishments, yet we must remind ourselves that they were not alone in this world.

Fascinating. The Serpent Folk had allies among the other races of this land. They lived alongside them for many years, sharing knowledge and learning from each other. It is clear to us now that the Serpent Folk did more than simply observe the other races; they actively sought out new ways to improve themselves. Their discoveries allowed them to advance their society beyond what any other race could have achieved on its own.  </p>
